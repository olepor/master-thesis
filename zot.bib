  abstract = {In this paper we present the PUMP (Parallel Uncertainty-aware Multiobjective Planning) algorithm for addressing the stochastic kinodynamic motion planning problem, whereby one seeks a low-cost, dynamically-feasible motion plan subject to a constraint on collision probability (CP). To ensure exhaustive evaluation of candidate motion plans (as needed to tradeoff the competing objectives of performance and safety), PUMP incrementally builds the Pareto front of the problem, accounting for the optimization objective and an approximation of CP. This is performed by a massively parallel multiobjective search, here implemented with a focus on GPUs. Upon termination of the exploration phase, PUMP searches the Pareto set of motion plans to identify the lowest cost solution that is certified to satisfy the CP constraint (according to an asymptotically exact estimator). We introduce a novel particle-based CP approximation scheme, designed for efficient GPU implementation, which accounts for dependencies over the history of a trajectory execution. We present numerical experiments for quadrotor planning wherein PUMP identifies solutions in \textasciitilde{}100 ms, evaluating over one hundred thousand partial plans through the course of its exploration phase. The results show that this multiobjective search achieves a lower motion plan cost, for the same CP constraint, compared to a safety buffer-based search heuristic and repeated RRT trials.},

  abstract = {We study stochastic motion planning problems which involve a controlled process, with possibly discontinuous sample paths, visiting certain subsets of the state-space while avoiding others in a sequential fashion. For this purpose, we first introduce two basic notions of motion planning, and then establish a connection to a class of stochastic optimal control problems concerned with sequential stopping times. A weak dynamic programming principle (DPP) is then proposed, which characterizes the set of initial states that admit a control enabling the process to execute the desired maneuver with probability no less than some pre-specified value. The proposed DPP comprises auxiliary value functions defined in terms of discontinuous payoff functions. A concrete instance of the use of this novel DPP in the case of diffusion processes is also presented. In this case, we establish that the aforementioned set of initial states can be characterized as the level set of a discontinuous viscosity solution to a sequence of partial differential equations, for which the first one has a known boundary condition, while the boundary conditions of the subsequent ones are determined by the solutions to the preceding steps. Finally, the generality and flexibility of the theoretical results are illustrated on an example involving biological switches.},

The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efﬁciently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and ﬁnding low cost paths.},

  title = {Periodic-Node {{Graph}}-Based {{Framework}} for {{Stochastic Control}} of {{Non}}-Point-Stabilizable {{Systems}}},
  abstract = {This paper presents a strategy for stochastic control of small aerial vehicles under uncertainty using graph-based methods. In planning with graph-based methods, such as the Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) in state space or the Information RoadMaps (IRM) in information-state (belief) space, the local planners (along the edges) are responsible to drive the state/belief to the ﬁnal node of the edge. However, for aerial vehicles with minimum velocity constraints, driving the system belief to a sampled belief is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on periodic controllers, in which instead of stabilizing the belief to a predeﬁned probability distribution, the belief is stabilized to an orbit (periodic path) of probability distributions. Choosing nodes along these orbits, the node reachability in belief space is achieved and we can form a graph in belief space that can handle higher-order-dynamics or non-stoppable systems (whose velocity cannot be zero), such as ﬁxedwing aircraft. The proposed method takes obstacles into account and provides a query-independent graph, since its edge costs are independent of each other, thus it satisﬁes the principle of optimality. Therefore, dynamic programming can be utilized to compute the best feedback on the graph. We demonstrate the method’s performance on a unicycle robot and a six degree of freedom small aerial vehicle.},

Due to the imperfect knowledge of the system state caused by motion uncertainty, sensor noise and environment uncertainty, the system constraints cannot be guaranteed to be satisﬁed and consequently must be considered probabilistically. To account for the uncertainty, the constraints are formulated as convex constraints on a random variable, known as chance constraints, with the violation probability of all the constraints guaranteed to be below a threshold. Standard chance constrained stochastic motion planning methods do not incorporate environmental sensing which typically leads to overly-conservative solutions. To address this, a novel hierarchical framework is proposed that consists of two main steps: an expected shortest path problem on an uncertain graph and a chance constrained motion planning problem. The ﬁrst successful, real-time experimental demonstration of chance constrained control with uncertain constraint parameters and variables is also presented for a quadrotor equipped with a Kinect sensor navigating through an uncertain, cluttered 3D environment.},

The approach is motivated by the motion planning problem for autonomous vehicles navigating in GPS-denied dynamic environments, which involves non-linear and/or non-holonomic vehicle dynamics, incomplete state estimates, and constraints imposed by uncertain and cluttered environments. To address the above motion planning problem, we propose an extension of the closed-loop rapid belief trees, the closed-loop random belief trees (CL-RBT), which incorporates predictions of the position estimation uncertainty, using a factored form of the covariance provided by the Kalman filter-based estimator. The proposed motion planner operates by incrementally constructing a tree of dynamically feasible trajectories using the closed-loop prediction, while selecting candidate paths with low uncertainty using efficient covariance update and propagation. The algorithm can operate in real-time, continuously providing the controller with feasible paths for execution, enabling the vehicle to account for dynamic and uncertain environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate feasible trajectories that reduce the state estimation uncertainty, while handling complex vehicle dynamics and environment constraints.},

  title = {Global {{Motion Planning}} under {{Uncertain Motion}}, {{Sensing}}, and {{Environment Map}}},
  abstract = {Motion planning that takes into account uncertainty in motion, sensing, and environment map, is critical for autonomous robots to operate reliably in our living spaces. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) is a principled and general framework for planning under uncertainty. Although recent development of point-based POMDPs have drastically increased the speed of POMDP planning, even the best POMDP planner today, fails to generate reasonable motion strategies when the environment map is not known exactly. This paper presents Guided Cluster Sampling (GCS), a new point-based POMDP planner for motion planning with uncertain motion, sensing, and environment map, when the robot has active sensing capability. It uses our observations that in this problem, the belief space B can be partitioned into a collection of much smaller sub-spaces, and an optimal policy can often be generated by sufﬁcient sampling of a small subset of the collection. GCS samples B using two-stage cluster sampling, a subspace is sampled from the collection and then a belief is sampled from the subspace. It uses information from the set of sampled sub-spaces and sampled beliefs to guide subsequent sampling. Preliminary results suggest that GCS generates reasonable policies for motion planning problems with uncertain motion, sensing, and environment map, that are unsolvable by the best point-based POMDP planner today, within reasonable time. Furthermore, GCS handles POMDPs with continuous state, action, and observation spaces. We show that for a class of POMDPs that often occur in robot motion planning, GCS converges to the optimal policy, given enough time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst convergence result for point-based POMDPs with continuous action space.},

The Feedback-based Information RoadMap (FIRM) framework made an important theoretical step toward enabling roadmap-based planning in belief space and provided a computationally tractable version of belief space planning. However, there are still challenges in applying belief space planners to physical systems, such as the discrepancy between computational models and real physical models. In this paper, we propose a dynamic replanning scheme in belief space to address such challenges. Moreover, we present techniques to cope with changes in the environment (e.g., changes in the obstacle map), as well as unforeseen large deviations in the robot’s location (e.g., the kidnapped robot problem). We then utilize these techniques to implement the ﬁrst online replanning scheme in belief space on a physical mobile robot that is robust to changes in the environment and large disturbances. This method demonstrates that belief space planning is a practical tool for robot motion planning.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we bring techniques from operations research to bear on the problem of choosing optimal actions in partially observable stochastic domains. We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving POMDPs off line and show how, in some cases, a ﬁnite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of ﬁnding exact solutions to POMDPs, and of some possibilities for ﬁnding approximate solutions. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  title = {A {{Sparse Sampling Algorithm}} for {{Near}}-{{Optimal Planning}} in {{Large Markov Decision Processes}}},
  abstract = {A critical issue for the application of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to realistic problems is how the complexity of planning scales with the size of the MDP. In stochastic environments with very large or inﬁnite state spaces, traditional planning and reinforcement learning algorithms may be inapplicable, since their running time typically grows linearly with the state space size in the worst case. In this paper we present a new algorithm that, given only a generative model (a natural and common type of simulator) for an arbitrary MDP, performs on-line, near-optimal planning with a per-state running time that has no dependence on the number of states. The running time is exponential in the horizon time (which depends only on the discount factor γ and the desired degree of approximation to the optimal policy). Our algorithm thus provides a different complexity trade-off than classical algorithms such as value iteration—rather than scaling linearly in both horizon time and state space size, our running time trades an exponential dependence on the former in exchange for no dependence on the latter.},

  abstract = {The task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot has received considerable attention in the research literature. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacriﬁcing optimality or computational efﬁciency respectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner.},

Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor “anytime” algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT⇤ which (like the RRT) ﬁnds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT⇤, committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efﬁcient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-ﬁdelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT⇤ methods. We also demonstrate experimental results for an outdoor wheeled robotic vehicle.},

The robot uses a graph-based SLAM system to perform mapping and represents the map as an occupancy grid. In this setting, the robot must trade-off between exploring new area to complete the task and exploiting the existing information to maintain good localization. Selecting actions that decrease the map uncertainty while not signiﬁcantly increasing the robot’s localization uncertainty is challenging. We present a novel information-theoretic utility function that uses both Shannon’s and Re´nyi’s deﬁnitions of entropy to jointly consider the uncertainty of the robot and the map. This allows us to fuse both uncertainties without the use of manual tuning. We present simulations and experiments comparing the proposed utility function to state-of-the-art utility functions, which only use Shannon’s entropy. We show that by using the proposed utility function, the robot and map uncertainties are smaller than using other existing methods.},

As mobile robots and autonomous vehicles become increasingly more prevalent in human-centered environments, the need to ensure safety in the sense of guaranteed collision free behaviour has taken renewed urgency. Achieving this when perceptual modules provide only noisy estimates of objects in the environment requires new approaches. Working within a probabilistic framework for describing the environment, we present methods for efﬁciently calculating a probabilistic risk of collision for a candidate path. This may be used to stratify a set of candidate trajectories by levels of a safety threshold. Given such a stratiﬁcation, based on user-deﬁned thresholds, motion synthesis techniques could optimise for secondary criteria with the assurance that a primary safety criterion is already being satisﬁed. A key contribution of this paper is the use of a ‘convolution trick’ to factor the calculation of integrals providing bounds on collision risk, enabling an O(1) computation even in cluttered and complex environments.},

Scene information is received using on-board sensors and communication network systems–i.e. infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities–i.e. Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) and vehicles–and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semiautomated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers is presented, allowing to understand the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.},

To enable safe motion planning it is vital to anticipate object movements. This paper presents an improved formulation for occupancy ﬁltering. Our approach is closely related to the Bayesian Occupancy Filter (BOF) presented in [4]. The basic idea of occupancy ﬁlters is to represent the environment as a 2dimensional grid of cells holding information about their state of occupancy and velocity. To improve the accuracy of predictions, prior knowledge about the motion preferences is used, derived from map data that can be obtained from navigation systems. In combination with a physically accurate transition model, it is possible to estimate the environment dynamics. Experiments show that this yields reliable estimates even for occluded regions.},

We propose a new motion planner, called Guided Cluster Sampling (GCS), that takes into account all three sources of uncertainty for robots with active sensing capabilities. GCS uses the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework and the point-based POMDP approach. Although point-based POMDPs have shown impressive progress over the past few years, it performs poorly when the environment map is imperfect. This poor performance is due to the extremely high dimensional state space, which translates to the extremely large belief space B.},

Many methods can be used to generate the required ensemble of candidate paths from which the best path is selected; in this paper we report results using rapidly exploring random trees (RRT).

  abstract = {This paper introduces a Monte-Carlo algorithm for online planning in large POMDPs. The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent’s belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, MonteCarlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan eﬀectively in signiﬁcantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 × 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 1018 and 1056 states respectively. Our MonteCarlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search. POMCP is the ﬁrst general purpose planner to achieve high performance in such large and unfactored POMDPs.},

  abstract = {The past decade has seen a significant breakthrough in research on solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Where past solvers could not scale beyond perhaps a dozen states, modern solvers can handle complex domains with many thousands of states. This breakthrough was mainly due to the idea of restricting value function computations to a ﬁnite subset of the belief space, permitting only local value updates for this subset. This approach, known as point-based value iteration, avoids the exponential growth of the value function, and is thus applicable for domains with longer horizons, even with relatively large state spaces. Many extensions were suggested to this basic idea, focusing on various aspects of the algorithm—mainly the selection of the belief space subset, and the order of value function updates. In this survey, we walk the reader through the fundamentals of point-based value iteration, explaining the main concepts and ideas. Then, we survey the major extensions to the basic algorithm, discussing their merits. Finally, we include an extensive empirical analysis using well known benchmarks, in order to shed light on the strengths and limitations of the various approaches.},

Impact of different parameters on algorithm’s performance is also evaluated. Moreover, a performance comparison for different optimality criteria such as path cost, run time and total number of nodes in tree is performed through simulation based experiments. Further, the comparative analysis is concluded with future research directions.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses motion planning for a mobile robot moving on a rough terrain. We proposed in [14] a geometrical planner for a particular architecture of robot. The approach was based on a discrete search technique operating in the (z, y, e ) configuration space of the robot, and on the evaluation of elementary feasible paths between two configurations. The overall efficiency of the approach was made possible by the use of fast algorithms for solving the placement problem and checking the validity of such placements. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we study the extension of this approach to an articulated vehicle composed of three axles connected to the chassis by joints allowing the roll and pitch movements. We also propose new algorithms to improve the robustness of the planner by considering additionnal constraints: uncertainties in the terrain model and existence of a free channel around the computed trajectory. Some simulation results presented at the end of the paper show the effectivenessof the planner which turns out to be both fast and capable of solving difficult problems.},

As sources of uncertainty actuator errors and map uncertainties are considered. We apply this framework to various scenarios for a non-holonomic vehicle and compare the resulting paths to heuristic state space planners and LQG-MP[1] with the help of simulations. As a result, paths generated with this framework could either not be found with worst-case assumptions or have a higher probability of being successfully executed compared to planners with more relaxed constraints.},

  abstract = {In recent years, optimization theory has been greatly impacted by the advent of sum of squares (SOS) optimization. The reliance of this technique on large-scale semideﬁnite programs however, has limited the scale of problems to which it can be applied. In this paper, we introduce DSOS and SDSOS optimization as more tractable alternatives to sum of squares optimization that rely instead on linear and second order cone programs respectively. These are optimization problems over certain subsets of sum of squares polynomials (or equivalently subsets of positive semideﬁnite matrices), which can be of interest in general applications of semideﬁnite programming where scalability is a limitation. We show that some basic theorems from SOS optimization which rely on results from real algebraic geometry are still valid for DSOS and SDSOS optimization. Furthermore, we show with numerical experiments from diverse application areas—polynomial optimization, statistics and machine learning, derivative pricing, and control theory—that with reasonable tradeo↵s in accuracy, we can handle problems at scales that are currently far beyond the reach of sum of squares approaches. Finally, we provide a review of recent techniques that bridge the gap between our DSOS/SDSOS approach and the SOS approach at the expense of additional running time. The appendix of the paper introduces an accompanying MATLAB package for DSOS and SDSOS optimization.},

In an ofﬂine phase, one computes the structure of a feedback controller that can be efﬁciently implemented online to track any feasible nominal trajectory. The ofﬂine phase leverages contraction theory and convex optimization to characterize a ﬁxed-size “tube” that the state is guaranteed to remain within while tracking a nominal trajectory (representing the center of the tube). In the online phase, when the robot is faced with obstacles, a motion planner uses such a tube as a robustness margin for collision checking, yielding nominal trajectories that can be safely executed, i.e., tracked without collisions under disturbances. In contrast to recent work on robust online planning using funnel libraries, our approach is not restricted to a ﬁxed library of maneuvers computed ofﬂine and is thus particularly well-suited to applications such as UAV ﬂight in densely cluttered environments where complex maneuvers may be required to reach a goal. We demonstrate our approach through simulations of a 6-state planar quadrotor navigating cluttered environments in the presence of a cross-wind. We also discuss applications of our approach to Tube Model Predictive Control (TMPC) and compare the merits of our method with state-of-the-art nonlinear TMPC techniques.},

  abstract = {Path planning for autonomous vehicles in arbitrary environments requires a guarantee of safety, but this can be impractical to ensure in real-time when the vehicle is described with a high-ﬁdelity model. To address this problem, this paper develops a method to perform trajectory design by considering a low-ﬁdelity model that accounts for model mismatch. The presented method begins by computing a conservative Forward Reachable Set (FRS) of a high-ﬁdelity model’s trajectories produced when tracking trajectories of a low-ﬁdelity model over a ﬁnite time horizon. At runtime, the vehicle intersects this FRS with obstacles in the environment to eliminate trajectories that can lead to a collision, then selects an optimal plan from the remaining safe set. By bounding the time for this set intersection and subsequent path selection, this paper proves a lower bound for the FRS time horizon and sensing horizon to guarantee safety. This method is demonstrated in simulation using a kinematic Dubin’s car as the low-ﬁdelity model and a dynamic unicycle as the highﬁdelity model.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a control approach with correctness guarantees for the simultaneous operation of lane keeping and adaptive cruise control. The safety speciﬁcations for these driver assistance modules are expressed in terms of set invariance. Control barrier functions are used to design a family of control solutions that guarantee the forward invariance of a set, which implies satisfaction of the safety speciﬁcations. The control barrier functions are synthesized through a combination of sum-of-squares program and physics-based modeling and optimization. A real-time quadratic program is posed to combine the control barrier functions with the performancebased controllers, which can be either expressed as control Lyapunov function conditions or as black-box legacy controllers. In both cases, the resulting feedback control guarantees the safety of the composed driver assistance modules in a formally correct manner. Importantly, the quadratic program admits a closed-form solution that can be easily implemented. The effectiveness of the control approach is demonstrated by simulations in the industry-standard vehicle simulator Carsim.},

  abstract = {Collision avoidance plays a crucial role in safe multirotor ﬂight in cluttered environments. Even though a given reference trajectory is designed to be collision free, it might lead to collision due to imperfect tracking caused by external disturbances. In this work, we tackle this problem by computing the Forward Reachable Set (FRS), which is the set of positions and velocities that a multirotor can reach while following a reference trajectory due to tracking errors. Hence, if the FRS is computed before ﬂight, we can utilize it to check the safety of a given trajectory in terms of collision avoidance. To compute a realistic FRS that covers an agile ﬂight envelope, we consider ﬁrst-order aerodynamic effects, which have the most salient inﬂuence on the vehicle. For computing FRS, we conduct a thorought stability analysis including these aerodynamic effects. Then, we present a FRS computation method which can easily be adapted to newly given reference trajectories. The presented method is validated by comparing the FRS with real ﬂight data collected during agile and high-speed ﬂight. In addition, we compare the FRS computed with and without compensating for ﬁrstorder aerodynamic effect to highlight their signiﬁcance on the trajectory tracking performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to compute FRSs by incorporating ﬁrstorder aerodynamic effects for multirotors.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach for designing feedback controllers for polynomial systems that maximize the size of the time-limited backwards reachable set (BRS). We rely on the notion of occupation measures to pose the synthesis problem as an inﬁnite dimensional linear program (LP) and provide ﬁnite dimensional approximations of this LP in terms of semideﬁnite programs (SDPs). The solution to each SDP yields a polynomial control policy and an outer approximation of the largest achievable BRS. In contrast to traditional Lyapunov based approaches which are non-convex and require feasible initialization, our approach is convex and does not require any form of initialization. The resulting time-varying controllers and approximated reachable sets are well-suited for use in a trajectory library or feedback motion planning algorithm. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy and scalability of our approach on ﬁve nonlinear systems.},
