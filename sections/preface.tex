\chapter{Preface}


This is where you write your personal experiences with the thesis, making a note of collaborations and contributions to authorship.

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Well, they must have been small, because I couldn't seem to find them}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    I dreamt I stood on a hill that I wished was a mountain
    \\
    To look back on all my accomplishments
    \\
    Well, they must have been small, because I couldn't seem to find them
    \\
    So, I took a leap off of the precipice\todo{Cite \emph{The Classic Crime}.}
\end{verse}
Then you say `Thanks for all the fish'. Alternatively, you skip the first part and rename `Preface' to `Acknowledgements'.
