\chapter{Discussion}

Although the motion primitives of the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm makes for a smooth
and robust traversal of the state-space, it is not in general probabilisticly
complete, as there are configurations that it cannot reach due to the discrete
nature of the motion primitives. This problem can be, and is solved
in~\cite{vonasekGlobalMotionPlanning2013}, through the addition of a randomly
sampled control input, in addition to the randomly sampled motion primitives.
This approach was not exploited for the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm as it would
remove the robustness guarantee that come with the funnel motion primitives.
