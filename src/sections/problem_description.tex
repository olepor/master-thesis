\section{The thesis problem description}

Current motion planning algorithms do not in the general case handle the problem
of uncertainty during planning. This is not optimal, in that all real-world
motion planning problems have to handle uncertainties. Therefore, develop a
motion planning algorithm that is robust to uncertainty, and verify the safe
traversal of the algorithm through simulation.

\subsection{What has been done by others}

The two main parts of the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm is the funnel generation
framework through \ac{SOS} programming. Although this is used in a lot of
different research, the strand that this thesis is based upon is a series of
papers~\cite{Tobenkin_2011,tedrakeLQRtreesFeedbackMotion2009,majumdarRobustOnlineMotion2013,majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017,ahmadi2014dsos}
with the main focus being on \cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}. The
second part is based on~\textcite{article} and the \ac{RRT} motion planning
algorithm, which is a simple algorithm that seeks to build a random tree that
quickly expands deeply into the state space, and due to its random nature is
good at avoiding local extrema.

\subsection{Scientific contributions of this thesis}

The contribution of this thesis is the combination of the \ac{RRT} motion
planning algorithm with the guaranteed safe traversal provided by the funnel
framework. These \textit{finite time reachable sets} are then employed as robust
motion primitives to the \ac{RRT} motion planner, letting it create a tree of
safe maneuvers as it searches for a path to the goal, all the while guaranteeing
safe traversal for the nonlinear dynamical model even in the face of
uncertainty.
