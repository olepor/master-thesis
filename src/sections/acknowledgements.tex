\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to acknowledge, and thank Dr. Majumdar for his kind help when I
have been stuck, and for his code stubs which provided the basis for the
implementation of this thesis, and for which I probably not would have gotten far.

Many thanks to my supervisors, Marius Thoresen and Kim Mathiassen, who have read
through the thesis many times, and helped polish the initial rubble into the
work which lays in front of you today. Now you be the judge.

Strangest part of the last eighteen months is that, even though I was a stranger
to motion planning -- all humble and ready to learn, I now probably have more
unanswered questions than I had before. Motion planning is a huge scientific
research area, spanning vast topics such as robotics to mathematical optimization
and computer science. All in which are beyond the scope of a single human being.

A big thanks to all my friends (you know who you are), for keeping me from
social and economical ruin these past two years.

And lastly, I would like to thank my dedicated and caring parents (my
step-parents also) for making me who I am today -- even though their efforts has
not gone unhindered.
