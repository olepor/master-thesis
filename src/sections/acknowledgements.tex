\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\noindent \textsf{I} would like to acknowledge and thank \textit{Dr.
  Majumdar} for his kind help when I have been stuck, and for his code stubs
which provided the basis for the implementation of this thesis, without which I
probably would not have gotten far.

\noindent \textsf{A} thanks also goes out to \textit{Prof. Russ
  Tedrake}, who, even though his time was limited, found the time for guidance,
and thoughtful insights.

\noindent \textsf{M}any thanks to my supervisors, \textit{Marius
  Thoresen} and \textit{Kim Mathiassen}, who have read through the thesis many
times, and helped polish the initial rubble into the work which lays in front of
you today.

\noindent \textsf{A} thanks to all my friends (you know who you are),
who have waited patiently for me to join the ranks of adulthood, while all along
having kept me from social and economic ruin.

\noindent \textsf{A} special thanks to \textit{Juliane Skuland
  Karling}, who, even though we are not together any longer, has still lent me
good advise and has read through the thesis several times, a feat which takes a
special kind of kindness.

\noindent \textsf{L}astly I would like to thank my parents (my
step-parents also) for molding me into who I am today -- even though their
efforts have not gone un-opposed.
