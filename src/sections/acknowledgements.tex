\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\paragraph{I} would like to acknowledge, and thank Dr. Majumdar for his kind
help when I have been stuck, and for his code stubs which provided the basis for
the implementation of this thesis, and for which I probably not would have
gotten far.


\paragraph{A} thanks also goes out to Prof. Russ Tedrake, who, even though his
time was limited, found the time for guidance, and thoughtful insights.

\paragraph{Many} thanks to my supervisors, Marius Thoresen and Kim Mathiassen,
who have read through the thesis many times, and helped polish the initial
rubble into the work which lays in front of you today.

\paragraph{A} thanks to all my friends (you know who you are), who have waited
patiently for me to join the ranks of adulthood, while all along having kept me
from social and economical ruin these past two years.

\paragraph{A} special thanks to Juliane Skuland Karling, who, even though we are
not together anylonger, has still lent me good advise and has read through the
thesis several times, a feat which takes a special kind of kindness.

\paragraph{lastly} I would like to thank my dedicated and caring parents
(my step-parents also) for making me who I am today -- even though their efforts
has not gone unhindered.


\paragraph{Thank you!}
