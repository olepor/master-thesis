\begin{itemize}
  \item The funnels can be made continous once again, in order to regain
    exactness. The computational time is not really of huge concern when the
    funnels are computed off-line, and huge computational resources can be
    thrown at the problem once the development phase is done.
  \item The RRT algorithm can be modified in any number of ways.
    * Grow it backwards from the goal, instead of from the origin.
    * This can further be exanded for 

  \item Try any other discrete motion planning technique, such as Grid-based
    planner. Any of the heuristic planners such as A*, D* etc.

  \item There is plenty of symmetry that goes unused in the thesis. As an
    example, there is nothing really seperating a left turn from a right turn,
    yet they are different motion primitives in the basis set.

  \item Bi-Directional planning tree.

  \item At least in the case of funnels without uncertainty, every sub-level set
    of a funnel is a funnel, and as such, the whole funnel can be shrunk to fit
    inside smaller openings. Research to what extent this is possible with
    uncertain funnels.
