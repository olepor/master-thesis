  This thesis develops the \rrtfunnel{} algorithm by combining the mathematical
  theory of convex optimization in order to search for Lyapunov functions which
  verify the stability of a smooth nonlinear system, along with a standard
  \ac{RRT} motion planning algorithm.

  The combination is made through verifying an outer approximation of the
  reachable set for a set of intial trajectories used as motion primitives in
  the global planner.

  Through the \ac{SOS} programming theory, the verified regions are guaranteed
  to give safe traversal of the planning environment, even in the presence of
  noise.

  The verified trajectories are then employed as local motion primitives, each
  with its locally valid \ac{LQR} controller, which are then combined into a
  tree of controllers by the \ac{RRT} motion planner. With each controller
  having a verified region of the state space, these verified regions of
  traversal is referred to as 'funnels', and are combined together, giving a
  certificate of safe traversal, if the funnels can be combined into a path from
  the intial state to the goal state.

  Lastly the algorithm is run through a simulated forest in order to show that
  the robustness guarantees hold, even in the presence of noise and obstacles,
  which is shown not to hold for a \ac{RRT} algorithm which does not reason
  about disturbances.
