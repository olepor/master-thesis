\subsection{How to simulate the system?}

\subsection{Genration of obstacles}

The forest was generated with trees represented as squares, distributed over a
map of some size, randomly, using the poisson distribution, as is done in the
\cite{majumdarFunnelLibrariesRealtime2017}. 

\subsubsection{Spatial point processes}

\subsubsection{Marked point processes}

For generating the trees, we use a marked point process, both to distribute the
trees randomly in the forest, but to also have varying sizes of the obstacles.
The implementation in the simulation TODO-ref-simulation. is based on
\cite{kroeseSpatialProcessGeneration}, and the blogpost \cite{zotero-187}, was
used for the matlab code.

\subsection{Collision detection}
