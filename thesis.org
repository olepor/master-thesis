* TODO 
** Create and model the vehichle in the thesis using Peter Corke's book, and unicycle model. ( Pretty figures needed ). see p 100.
** Fixup the preliminaries next week!
*** Monday: Structure the rest of the week preliminaries write up, after work!
*** Tuesday: Thesis writing & Start on the funnel composition code.
*** Wednesday: Thesis writing & If done with funnel composition -> Integrate into FunnelGraph code.
*** Thursday: Thesis writing & If done with Integration into FunnelGraph code -> Create a richer funnel library.
*** Friday: Thesis writing & If done with richer funnel library -> Start the algorithm comparisons.
** Write the Poisson forest generation section in the thesis.
